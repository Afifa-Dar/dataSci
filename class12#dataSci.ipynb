Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content and translates it into a relational form, is called a wrapper. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.[2] Moreover, some semi-structured data query languages, such as XQuery and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.\n",

The best known of these cases, eBay v. Bidder's Edge, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as auction sniping. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[9]\n",

The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003.

Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of \"Computer Fraud and Abuse\" and has led to \"Damage and Loss\" and \"Unauthorized Access\" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes \"Interference with Business Relations\", \"Trespass\", and \"Harmful Access by Computer\". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as \"Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment\", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should be US Copyright law and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the Supreme Court of the United States, FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company Yahoo!, and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.[12]\n",

However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.[13]\n",

In a 2010 ruling in the Cvent, Inc. v. Eventbrite, Inc. In the United States district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the court ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users' attention In order for a browse wrap contract or license to be enforced.[14] In a 2014 case, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,[15] e-commerce site QVC objected to the Pinterest-like shopping aggregator Resultly's 'scraping of QVC's site for real-time pricing data. QVC alleges that Resultly \"excessively crawled\" QVC's retail site (allegedly sending 200-300 search requests to QVC's website per minute, sometimes to up to 36,000 requests per minute) which caused QVC's site to crash for two days, resulting in lost sales for QVC.[16] QVC's complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source IP address and thus prevented QVC from quickly repairing the problem. This is a particularly interesting scraping case because QVC is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website, which QVC claims was caused by Resultly.\n",

In contrast to the findings of the United States District Court Eastern District of Virginia and those of the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court, Justice Michael Hanna ruled that the hyperlink to Ryanair's terms and conditions was plainly visible, and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship.[21] The decision is under appeal in Ireland's Supreme Court.[22]\n",

       " <p>Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Semantic_web\" title=\"Semantic web\">semantic web</a> vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Human-computer_interaction\" title=\"Human-computer interaction\">human-computer interactions</a>.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>The simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet. Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human's manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX <a href=\"/wiki/Grep\" title=\"Grep\">grep</a> command or <a href=\"/wiki/Regular_expression\" title=\"Regular expression\">regular expression</a>-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance <a href=\"/wiki/Perl\" title=\"Perl\">Perl</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Python_(programming_language)\" title=\"Python (programming language)\">Python</a>).\n",

       " <p><a href=\"/wiki/Static_web_page\" title=\"Static web page\">Static</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Dynamic_web_page\" title=\"Dynamic web page\">dynamic web pages</a> can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Socket_programming\" title=\"Socket programming\">socket programming</a>.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content and translates it into a relational form, is called a <a href=\"/wiki/Wrapper_(data_mining)\" title=\"Wrapper (data mining)\">wrapper</a>. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> Moreover, some <a href=\"/wiki/Semi-structured_data\" title=\"Semi-structured data\">semi-structured data</a> query languages, such as <a href=\"/wiki/XQuery\" title=\"XQuery\">XQuery</a> and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>By embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Internet_Explorer\" title=\"Internet Explorer\">Internet Explorer</a> or the <a href=\"/wiki/Mozilla\" title=\"Mozilla\">Mozilla</a> browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages. Languages such as <a href=\"/wiki/XPath\" title=\"XPath\">Xpath</a> can be used to parse the resulting DOM tree.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of \"bots\" for specific verticals with no \"man in the loop\" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Long_Tail\" title=\"Long Tail\">Long Tail</a> of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>The pages being scraped may embrace <a href=\"/wiki/Metadata\" title=\"Metadata\">metadata</a> or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as <a href=\"/wiki/Microformat\" title=\"Microformat\">Microformat</a> does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.\n",

       " <p>There are efforts using <a href=\"/wiki/Machine_learning\" title=\"Machine learning\">machine learning</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Computer_vision\" title=\"Computer vision\">computer vision</a> that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-4\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>There are many software tools available that can be used to customize web-scraping solutions. This software may attempt to automatically recognize the data structure of a page or provide a recording interface that removes the necessity to manually write web-scraping code, or some scripting functions that can be used to extract and transform content, and database interfaces that can store the scraped data in local databases. Some web scraping software can also be used to extract data from an API directly.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>The legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Terms_of_use\" title=\"Terms of use\">terms of use</a> of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>In the United States, website owners can use three major <a href=\"/wiki/Cause_of_action\" title=\"Cause of action\">legal claims</a> to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the <a href=\"/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act\" title=\"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a> (\"CFAA\"), and (3) <a href=\"/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels\" title=\"Trespass to chattels\">trespass to chattel</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup> However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in <a href=\"/wiki/Feist_Publications,_Inc.,_v._Rural_Telephone_Service_Co.\" title=\"Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.\"><i>Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service</i></a> that duplication of facts is allowable.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of \"scrapers\" or \"robots\" may be held liable for committing <a href=\"/wiki/Trespass_to_chattels\" title=\"Trespass to chattels\">trespass to chattels</a>,<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-7\"><a href=\"#cite_note-7\">[7]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-8\"><a href=\"#cite_note-8\">[8]</a></sup> which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, <i><a href=\"/wiki/EBay_v._Bidder%27s_Edge\" title=\"EBay v. Bidder's Edge\">eBay v. Bidder's Edge</a></i>, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as <a href=\"/wiki/Auction_sniping\" title=\"Auction sniping\">auction sniping</a>. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to <a href=\"/wiki/Personal_property\" title=\"Personal property\">chattels</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Plaintiff\" title=\"Plaintiff\">plaintiff</a> must demonstrate that the <a href=\"/wiki/Defendant\" title=\"Defendant\">defendant</a> intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-9\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></sup>\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>One of the first major tests of <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Screen_scraping\" title=\"Screen scraping\">screen scraping</a> involved <a href=\"/wiki/American_Airlines\" title=\"American Airlines\">American Airlines</a> (AA), and a firm called FareChase.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-10\"><a href=\"#cite_note-10\">[10]</a></sup> AA successfully obtained an <a href=\"/wiki/Injunction\" title=\"Injunction\">injunction</a> from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches AA's website. The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup>\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p><a href=\"/wiki/Southwest_Airlines\" title=\"Southwest Airlines\">Southwest Airlines</a> has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of \"Computer Fraud and Abuse\" and has led to \"Damage and Loss\" and \"Unauthorized Access\" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes \"Interference with Business Relations\", \"Trespass\", and \"Harmful Access by Computer\". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as \"Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment\", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should be <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/US_Copyright_law\" title=\"US Copyright law\">US Copyright law</a> and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the <a href=\"/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States\" title=\"Supreme Court of the United States\">Supreme Court of the United States</a>, FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company <a href=\"/wiki/Yahoo!\" title=\"Yahoo!\">Yahoo!</a>, and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-impervawp2011_12-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-impervawp2011-12\">[12]</a></sup>\n",
       " In 2012, a startup called 3Taps scraped classified housing ads from Craigslist. Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in <i><a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Craigslist_v._3Taps\" title=\"Craigslist v. 3Taps\">Craigslist v. 3Taps</a></i>. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the <a href=\"/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act\" title=\"Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a>.\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>Although these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup>\n",
       " </p>,\n",
       " <p>While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site.

For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service that duplication of facts is allowable.\n",

      "U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of \"scrapers\" or \"robots\" may be held liable for committing trespass to chattels,[7][8] which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, eBay v. Bidder's Edge, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as auction sniping. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[9]\n",

      "One of the first major tests of screen scraping involved American Airlines (AA), and a firm called FareChase.[10] AA successfully obtained an injunction from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches AA's website. The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.[11]\n",

      "Southwest Airlines has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of \"Computer Fraud and Abuse\" and has led to \"Damage and Loss\" and \"Unauthorized Access\" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes \"Interference with Business Relations\", \"Trespass\", and \"Harmful Access by Computer\". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as \"Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment\", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should be US Copyright law and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the Supreme Court of the United States, FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company Yahoo!, and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.[12]\n",

However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.[13]\n",

      "While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site. In a 2010 ruling in the Cvent, Inc. v. Eventbrite, Inc. In the United States district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the court ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users' attention In order for a browse wrap contract or license to be enforced.[14] In a 2014 case, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,[15] e-commerce site QVC objected to the Pinterest-like shopping aggregator Resultly's 'scraping of QVC's site for real-time pricing data. QVC alleges that Resultly \"excessively crawled\" QVC's retail site (allegedly sending 200-300 search requests to QVC's website per minute, sometimes to up to 36,000 requests per minute) which caused QVC's site to crash for two days, resulting in lost sales for QVC.[16] QVC's complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source IP address and thus prevented QVC from quickly repairing the problem. This is a particularly interesting scraping case because QVC is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website, which QVC claims was caused by Resultly.\n",
